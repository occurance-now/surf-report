# surf-report
web scraping NOAA and API updated google sheets automatically

Obtaining realtime data for NOAA repositories. Connected to remote buoy's and weather stations. 

Filters data from NOAA into usable form

Use's google API to send data to a google sheets

I'll make physical observations on the surf every day and rate the surf from 0-5

After 3 months of data mining NOAA and making observations the goal will be to use the NOAA data is independent variable vs. 
  physical observations as dependent variables in a machine learning algorithm.
  
The alogorithm will then be able to rate the surf based off of current buoy data!!!!
